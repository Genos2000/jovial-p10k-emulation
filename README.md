# jovial-p10k-emulation
My p10k config to mimic jovial.  As ALWAYS, you can change whatever you want.

# Installation
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krypticallusion/jovial-p10k-emulation/master/install.sh -sS | sudo bash -s $USER
```

This will install zsh, Oh My Zsh and p10k as well if you dont have them
